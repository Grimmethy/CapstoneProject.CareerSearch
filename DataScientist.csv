"Research Scientist, Robotics - New College Graduate",$89K-$107K (Glassdoor est.),"We are looking for a Research Scientist, Robotics - New College Graduate:

NVIDIA’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics, and revolutionized parallel computing. More recently, GPU deep learning ignited modern AI — the next era of computing — with the GPU acting as the brain of computers, robots, and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Today, we are increasingly known as “the AI computing company.” We're looking to grow our company, and build our teams with the smartest people in the world. Join us at the forefront of technological advancement!

Robotics is an increasingly exciting field, influenced heavily by recent advances in hardware acceleration through devices such as the modern GPU. These advances have enabled tremendous progress in several areas of robotics, including manipulation, visual recognition and real-time tracking, and learning-based control. Robots are getting increasingly proficient at building 3D maps of their environments, detecting and tracking objects and people as they move through the world, learning controllers from realistic simulation, and understanding commands provided via gestures and natural language.

While our ultimate goal is to reach human-level dexterity, perception, and adaptability, we still have a long way to go. To enable the next generation of robots that can robustly manipulate the physical world and interact with people in a natural way, progress is still needed in each of these underlying domains and, perhaps even more importantly, in the integration of these individual contributions into complete robot systems. Toward this goal, the NVIDIA Robotics Research Lab brings together a diverse, interdisciplinary research team working on core robotics topics ranging from control and perception to task planning and collaboration, and critical related areas such as computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing.

The lab focuses on basic research; lab members are encouraged to publish their work and share code open source. It is located near the University of Washington to enable close collaboration with students and faculty at UW. The lab hosts numerous internships every year to foster education and communication, and the team is encouraged to collaborate broadly with external institutes and robotics companies. NVIDIA is well known for its team culture, and lab researchers are able to closely interact with others within the company who are experts in computer vision, deep learning, self-driving cars, and physics-based simulation.

The following research areas are of particular interest:
Robot manipulation
Robot control and reinforcement learning
Computer vision
HRI
Deep learning
Physics-based simulation
Natural language processing
What we need to see:

Pursuing PhD in Robotics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering or related field.
3+ years of relevant research or work experience
Knowledge of theory and practice of robotics, or a related area with a strong interest in connecting your work to robotics scenarios.
A track record of research excellence with your work published in top conferences and journals such as RSS, ICRA, IROS, T-RO, IJRR, NIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICML, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP
Exceptional programming skills in Python, MATLAB, and/or C/C++; CUDA and fluency in modern deep learning toolsets such as TensorFlow or Torch is a plus.
Strong communication and interpersonal skills are required along with the ability to work in a dynamic, research focused team. Your history of mentoring junior engineers and interns a huge plus.
Are you dedicated, upbeat and dynamic with excellent analytical ability? Are you an engineer passionate and highly motivated about solving complex problems? If so, you may be a perfect fit for NVIDIA!

The BBI Advanced Technology Lab, is the only physical lab at the institute, it is co-directed by Lea Starita and Jay Shendure at the University of Washington. The mission of Advanced Technology is to make cutting-edge ‘-omics’ technologies, including many developed by labs at the member institutions, broadly available to the institute’s research community. A major roadblock in fully realizing the potential of precision medicine is our lack of ability to understand the effect of genetic variants identified by genetic testing. The Advanced Technology lab will bring mutational scanning methods to production scale to increase the availability of functional data to inform variant interpretation.

The Advanced Technology lab has a large budget and broad institutional support which will help us achieve maximum success. Building this lab, completing the mutational scanning projects and enabling the community to perform mutational scans will have an immediate and powerful impact on the practice of precision medicine. This is especially so because of the placement of the BBI at the intersection between research labs and the clinic. Your contributions will be recognized not only in Seattle by the BBI community but nationally and internationally, as you will have ample opportunities to lead publications as well as to attend/present at conferences. We anticipate this role has growth potential analogous to that of Institute Scientists at the Broad Institute (Broad Institute), many of whom are well recognized leaders in their field.

Responsibilities

Under the direction of Drs. Jay Shendure and Lea Starita, the Director of Mutational Scanning will manage all aspects of mutational scanning efforts. The scientist should have experience in molecular biology and genomics, experience with large-scale efforts would be a plus.

The Advanced Technology Lab will continue to optimize and offer services based on technologies developed by institute labs in Genome Sciences and elsewhere. The candidate will also work with the other more clinically focused platforms at the Brotman Baty Institute to aid in translating the methods from the Advanced Technology lab into the clinic. The candidate will have the ability to shape the goals and culture of the lab. A portion of your time will also be reserved for the development of new, related technologies.

You would participate in Shendure lab and Center for Multiplexed Assessment of Phenotype (CMAP) meetings and functions to help build community and communications between the Advanced Technology lab and those groups. The Shendure lab and CMAP together are full of very smart, helpful and fun individuals with unique and diverse scientific strengths.
