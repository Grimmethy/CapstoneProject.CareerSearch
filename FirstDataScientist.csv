"Research Scientist, Robotics - New College Graduate",-1,"We are looking for a Research Scientist, Robotics - New College Graduate:

NVIDIA’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics, and revolutionized parallel computing. More recently, GPU deep learning ignited modern AI — the next era of computing — with the GPU acting as the brain of computers, robots, and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Today, we are increasingly known as “the AI computing company.” We're looking to grow our company, and build our teams with the smartest people in the world. Join us at the forefront of technological advancement!

Robotics is an increasingly exciting field, influenced heavily by recent advances in hardware acceleration through devices such as the modern GPU. These advances have enabled tremendous progress in several areas of robotics, including manipulation, visual recognition and real-time tracking, and learning-based control. Robots are getting increasingly proficient at building 3D maps of their environments, detecting and tracking objects and people as they move through the world, learning controllers from realistic simulation, and understanding commands provided via gestures and natural language.

While our ultimate goal is to reach human-level dexterity, perception, and adaptability, we still have a long way to go. To enable the next generation of robots that can robustly manipulate the physical world and interact with people in a natural way, progress is still needed in each of these underlying domains and, perhaps even more importantly, in the integration of these individual contributions into complete robot systems. Toward this goal, the NVIDIA Robotics Research Lab brings together a diverse, interdisciplinary research team working on core robotics topics ranging from control and perception to task planning and collaboration, and critical related areas such as computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing.

The lab focuses on basic research; lab members are encouraged to publish their work and share code open source. It is located near the University of Washington to enable close collaboration with students and faculty at UW. The lab hosts numerous internships every year to foster education and communication, and the team is encouraged to collaborate broadly with external institutes and robotics companies. NVIDIA is well known for its team culture, and lab researchers are able to closely interact with others within the company who are experts in computer vision, deep learning, self-driving cars, and physics-based simulation.

The following research areas are of particular interest:
Robot manipulation
Robot control and reinforcement learning
Computer vision
HRI
Deep learning
Physics-based simulation
Natural language processing
What we need to see:

Pursuing PhD in Robotics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering or related field.
3+ years of relevant research or work experience
Knowledge of theory and practice of robotics, or a related area with a strong interest in connecting your work to robotics scenarios.
A track record of research excellence with your work published in top conferences and journals such as RSS, ICRA, IROS, T-RO, IJRR, NIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICML, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP
Exceptional programming skills in Python, MATLAB, and/or C/C++; CUDA and fluency in modern deep learning toolsets such as TensorFlow or Torch is a plus.
Strong communication and interpersonal skills are required along with the ability to work in a dynamic, research focused team. Your history of mentoring junior engineers and interns a huge plus.
Are you dedicated, upbeat and dynamic with excellent analytical ability? Are you an engineer passionate and highly motivated about solving complex problems? If so, you may be a perfect fit for NVIDIA!
NVIDIA is committed to fostering a diverse work environment and proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for six consecutive years.

The Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington (APL-UW) is a national center for advanced science and engineering research and development and education. APL-UW was formed in 1943 for the U.S. Navy to bring university research resources to bear on urgent WWII defense problems. APL-UW has developed an international reputation for its broad based programs in science, engineering and for designing, building, and deploying the advanced technology required to meet the research needs of numerous government and commercial sponsors. With modern facilities, equipment and over 350 talented researchers and staff, APL-UW provides a unique, dynamic work environment with many opportunities.

Today our scientists and engineers make important contributions to understanding the earth's climate cycles with satellite and in situ sensing of ocean winds, currents, and air-sea fluxes; observations of Arctic sea ice, its variations and effects on mid-latitude oceans; and ocean tomography that reveals how the abyssal ocean mixes and sequesters carbon. APL-UW continues to lead research in the basic and applied physics of sound—from sonars used to probe the geology of the deep ocean floor to hand-held high-frequency focused ultrasound devices to image and stop internal bleeding without surgery.

APL-UW has an outstanding opportunity for a Research Scientist/Engineer in the Environmental & Information Systems (EIS) to support signal processing programs, with emphasis on low-power/high-performance applications in fielded maritime systems.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for six consecutive years.

We seek a scientist with strong leadership skills to direct our mutational scanning efforts and experiments within the Advanced Technology Lab.

Background on University of Washington, the Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, and the Advanced Technology Laboratory:

The University of Washington (UW) is proud to be one of the nation’s premier educational and research institutions. Our people are the most important asset in our pursuit of achieving excellence in education, research, and community service. Our staff not only enjoys outstanding benefits and professional growth opportunities, but also an environment noted for diversity, community involvement, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits, and natural beauty.

The Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine (BBI) is looking for a candidate to fill a unique scientist position at the intersection of genomic technology development and medicine. The institute bridges the University of Washington, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Seattle Children’s Hospital. The BBI Advanced Technology Lab, is the only physical lab at the institute, it is co-directed by Lea Starita and Jay Shendure at the University of Washington. The mission of Advanced Technology is to make cutting-edge ‘-omics’ technologies, including many developed by labs at the member institutions, broadly available to the institute’s research community. A major roadblock in fully realizing the potential of precision medicine is our lack of ability to understand the effect of genetic variants identified by genetic testing. The Advanced Technology lab will bring mutational scanning methods to production scale to increase the availability of functional data to inform variant interpretation.

The Advanced Technology lab has a large budget and broad institutional support which will help us achieve maximum success. Building this lab, completing the mutational scanning projects and enabling the community to perform mutational scans will have an immediate and powerful impact on the practice of precision medicine. This is especially so because of the placement of the BBI at the intersection between research labs and the clinic. Your contributions will be recognized not only in Seattle by the BBI community but nationally and internationally, as you will have ample opportunities to lead publications as well as to attend/present at conferences. We anticipate this role has growth potential analogous to that of Institute Scientists at the Broad Institute (Broad Institute), many of whom are well recognized leaders in their field.

Responsibilities

Under the direction of Drs. Jay Shendure and Lea Starita, the Director of Mutational Scanning will manage all aspects of mutational scanning efforts. The scientist should have experience in molecular biology and genomics, experience with large-scale efforts would be a plus.

The Advanced Technology Lab will continue to optimize and offer services based on technologies developed by institute labs in Genome Sciences and elsewhere.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
